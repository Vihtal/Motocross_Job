THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A FREE GOKART JOB THAT I FOUND THAT WAS IN FRENCH SO I TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH AND MADE IT MOTOCROSS
BIKES INSTEAD OF GOKARTS, ONLY THING YOU NEED TO CHANGE IS IN THE CLIENT OF WHAT DIRTBIKEST TO SPAWN IN!


PLAYERS CAN GO ON JOB AND HEAD TO THE DIRTTRACKS TO SPAWN DIRTBIKES IN FOR PEOPLE TO RACE, IT HAS AN INVENTORY AND A BILLING/ANNOUCE
SYSTEM, ALSO WHILE ON DUTY THEY CAN FIX THE DIRTBIKES LIKE A MECHANIC
